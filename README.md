## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Backend server running (see [TSN backend repo](https://github.com/ISEP-Projects-JH/TSN))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ISEP-Projects-JH/TSN-Frontend.git
cd TSN-Frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
